      <h1>About me:</h1>
      <p>
        Hi, I’m Niko, a music producer and guitarist with a deep passion for
        creating music that moves people. My journey began at the age of ten
        when I picked up a guitar for the first time, and from that moment,
        music became my life’s path. I started my own band early on, which
        opened doors to collaborations with a range of amazing artists like TCT,
        Dilemma, Erik Grönwall, New Horizon, and many others.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        A few years ago, I expanded my passion into music production, working
        with a variety of artists across genres from heavier rock to mellow pop
        music. Throughout the years I’ve produced numerous tracks and built a
        catalog of hundreds of songs that reflect my musical experience.
      </p>
      <br /><br />
      <p>
        In addition to production, I’ve been touring the world as the guitarist
        for the rock band Temple Balls since 2017, delivering high-energy
        performances to fans globally. One of the greatest milestones was to hit
        1 million streams on Spotify with my song back in 2021.
      </p>

      <br /><br /><br />
      <p>
        Whether it’s on stage or in the studio, my goal has always been the
        same: to craft and present authentic, powerful music that resonates with
        people.
